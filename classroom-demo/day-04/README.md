# SAPIENT ASDE - JUNE, 2021

### TOC for day 4:

-   Creating a docker image
-   SOLID principles using Java
-   Use cases and implementation
-   Design patterns overview
-   Creational patterns
-   Structural patterns
-   Behavioral patterns
-   Use cases and implementation (most useful patterns only)

### SOLID principles

-   S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
-   O - Open/Closed Principle
-   L - Liskov's substitution Principle
-   I - Interface segregation Principle
-   D - Dependency inversion Principle

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

-   class should be having one and only one responsibility

### Open/Closed Principle

-   classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

### Liskov's substitution Principle

-   Parent classes should be easily substituted with their child classes without blowing up the application
-   Child classes should never break the parent class' type definitions.
-   Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

### Interface segregation Principle

-   Many client specific interfaces are better than one general interface

### Dependency inversion Principle

-   Classes should depend on abstraction but not on concretion
-   High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
-   Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
